Abstract:
This report explores the operation principle and limitations of an ultrasonic ranging module (HC-SR04) and demonstrates a simple car
parking assistant. A Raspberry Pi is used to control the ultrasonic ranging module and its limitations are measured by means of a ruler
and protractor. It is found that generally the range of an object scales with the objectâ€™s surface area. Finally, using a button switch,
an IO expander, python code and several LEDs, the principle of a car parking sensor is demonstrated.
